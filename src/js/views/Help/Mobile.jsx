          Simply visit our signup page and follow the prompts. From here you’ll be asked to enter your details and create a uPoint Account. In the future this uPoint will get you immediate access to other services like NBN, Electricity and Gas, Insurance, Fuel and Grocery discounts.

      <Collapsible trigger={'What is this mobile signup process?'} transitionTime={100}>
        <ul className="mb-0 ml-0 pl-3">
          <li>
              Once you’ve established your uPoint account you can signup for your first service, mobile! uPoint leverages the Telstra 4G network to deliver the exceptional coverage most Australians are us to.
          </li>
          <li>
              Please be aware that as you’re changing providers you’ll need to be sent out a SIM card - this is whether you’re singing up a NEW number or PORTING a number.
          </li>
          <li>
              uPoint will post the SIM card out to you, with insurrections on how to activate through upoint.com.au, and if at any stage you need to have a chat you can call us on 1300 156 556

              Of course you can! When proceeding through the sign-up process, just select ‘Port In’ my existing number, and NOT ‘New Number’
          </li>
          <li>
              If you’re wondering how long it takes to cut over your existing number - most take just a few minutes, once your SIM card has been received in the mail, however if there are network issues it can take up to 24-hours.

          <li>
              uPoint wanted to provide members and customers with the very best experience and coverage possible, that’s why uPoint uses parts of Telstra’s 4G and 3G network, covering over 23 million Australians
          </li>

              Why shouldn’t we just go to Telstra?

              Great question, and the answer is simple. uPoint offers the same great service and coverage, but at a lower price and profits are being distributed back to the union movement! I don’t think Telstra donates back to the movement…?
