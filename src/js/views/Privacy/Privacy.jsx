                This Privacy Policy has been published to provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal information is collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by UPoint. The Policy relates to personal information collected by any means and by any technology. UPoint treats the handling of your personal information very seriously. To that end, UPoint has systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your personal information. UPoint abides by the Australian Privacy Principles, which provide a scheme in relation to the collection, disclosure, use and storage of personal information.<br />
                UPoint’s objective is to handle information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way information about you is handled.

                    Collection of Personal Information Personal information is information or opinion from which an individual’s identity may be ascertained. The nature of personal information collected by UPoint generally comprises an individual’s name and contact details (including address, phone, fax and e-mail) and opinions about products, services or staff. If possible and reasonably practical you will have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym in providing such information. However, if you do not identify yourself, UPoint may not be able to give you’re the information and services you would otherwise receive. Such personal information is collected for the purposes of arranging, conducting and promoting UPoint’s business activities. UPoint does not collect personal information unless it is reasonably necessary for UPoint to perform one or more of its functions and business activities. On occasion, some of this personal information may be sensitive and UPoint will only collect it with your consent or when required to by law. UPoint will destroy personal information when it is no longer required for such functions and business activities. UPoint will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, UPoint may collect personal information via telephone, email or letter, or when you attend a function or event, provide a resume or enter an agreement.

                    Use &amp; Disclosure of Personal Information Personal information provided to UPoint may be shared with related companies within UPoint, where it will be kept strictly confidential and will only be disclosed on a need to know basis. UPoint will use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which the personal information was initially collected. UPoint may also use that personal information for a purpose related to the initial purpose of collection if that other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related purposes might include internal auditing and administration, adding your name to a contact list, guest list or invitation list or helping us to identify production and broadcast business activities or investment opportunities which may be of benefit or interest to you. UPoint will not use or disclose your personal information for any other purposes without first obtaining your express or implied consent.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>UPoint may however be required to disclose your personal information without your consent if the disclosure is:</strong>
                    <ul className={'list-disc'}>
                      <li>required or authorised by law;</li>
                      <li>required in order to investigate an unlawful activity;</li>
                      <li>required by an enforcement body for investigative activities; or</li>
                      <li>necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person’s life, health or safety, or to public health or safety.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Generally, UPoint will retain your personal information within Australia and not use or disclose it overseas. However, on some occasions the information may need to be transferred overseas in order to perform one of UPoint’s functions or activities. In these circumstances, UPoint will either obtain your express or implied consent or will take such steps as a reasonable to ensure that your personal information will receive protection similar to that which it would have if the information were in Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like most business organisations, UPoint relies on third party suppliers who are contracted to conduct specialised activities such as insurance broking, supply of equipment, business services, security services and travel and hospitality services. While personal information may be provided to these suppliers in order to enable them to perform the agreed tasks, UPoint will make every effort to ensure that the supplier handles the personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles and confidentiality principles. UPoint will require all such suppliers to provide privacy undertakings and where necessary enter confidentiality agreements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>UPoint may also need to provide your personal information to third parties where:</strong>
                    <ul className={'list-disc'}>
                      <li>
                        UPoint are (in limited circumstances) allowed or required to by law or where they have a public duty to do so. For example, a Court, a regulator (such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) or the Australian Tax Office (ATO)) or the police can compel the disclosure of personal information; or
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You have expressly consented to your personal information being supplied to others. Usually such consent will be required in writing however in special circumstances You may be able to provide consent verbally; or
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It can be reasonably inferred from the circumstance that you consent to your personal information being disclosed. For example your consent will be implied for UPoint to use and disclosure your information to inform you of products and services that UPoint believes may interest you.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However your implied consent may be withdrawn at any time. We may sometimes have to transfer your personal information overseas, including but not limited to recipients located in the United States of America. We will only do so in accordance with the Australia Privacy Principles and Australian privacy law in general.

                    Access to Personal Information You may request access to the personal information UPoint holds about you. The procedure for gaining access is as follows:
                    <ul className={'list-disc'}>
                      <li>
                        All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing and addressed to the Privacy Officer.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity, department or person to whom you believe your personal information has been provided, and when. This will allow UPoint to process your request faster.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        UPoint will acknowledge your request within 14 days, and access will usually be granted within 30 days or otherwise within a reasonable period after the request is made. UPoint will inform you if this timeframe is not achievable.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You will be asked to verify your identity.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is onerous or time consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in locating and collating information, and reproduction costs.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Depending on the circumstances, UPoint will make all reasonable attempts to give access to the information in the manner you requested. If the manner requested is not reasonable and/or practicable you may be forwarded the information by another means reasonable in the circumstances, for example by mail or email, or you may be required to personally inspect your records at the appropriate place.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information which is no longer accurate. In some circumstances, UPoint may not be in a position to provide access. Such circumstances include where:
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        access would create a serious threat to safety;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        providing access will have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        denying access is required or authorised by law;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        the request is frivolous or vexatious;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        legal proceedings are underway or otherwise anticipated; • negotiations may be prejudiced by such access; or
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        access would reveal a commercially sensitive decision making process. If UPoint denies access to your personal information, it will provide you with reasons in writing.
